        <h3><strong>Process For Dough.</strong></h2>
		<p>In a bowl add maida, salt, carom seeds, ghee and mix everything properly until it resembles bread crumb consistency.
Now add cold water and knead a hard dough. Cover and keep aside for resting at least for 15-20 minutes.</p>
		<h3><strong>For Samosa Masala.</strong></h3>
		<p>In a pan add coriander seeds, cumin seeds, fennel seeds and roast them lightly.
Transfer them into a motor-pastel and crush them coarsely and keep aside for further use.</P>
		<h3><strong>For Samosa Filling.</strong></h3>
		<p>In a pan add ghee, ginger, garlic, green chillies and saute for a minute.
Now add raisins, turmeric powder, degi red chilli powder, asafoetida, potatoes, green peas and mash it coarsely, mix everything properly and cover and cook for 4-5 minutes on medium heat.
Now remove the cover and cook on high flames for 3-4 minutes or until light charred.
Add the prepared masala, black pepper powder, dry Mango powder, salt and mix everything properly. And keep aside for further use.</p>
		<h3><strong>For Assembling Samosa.</strong></h3>
		<p>Take a medium portion of the dough, make a round peda and roll it thin in an oval shape.
Now cut in from the centre and take one half of it and make a cone shape of it and add the filling in it.
Now apply water on the open ends of the cone and fold it towards you, keep it down and give it a gentle press so that it can stand, make all others in the similar way.
Heat oil in a kadhai on medium heat and fry the samosas in it until golden brown from all sides, remove on an absorbent paper. Serve hot with tomato ketchup.</p>
